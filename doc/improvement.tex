\section*{Mailing List}
A mailing list has been setup by the library authors. 
On this list, we discuss issues like the design and implementation of the library, 
most wanted features, bugs,
and, of course, all kinds of other issues \smile.

Information regarding the mailing list may be found at \href{http://www.terborg.net/mailman/listinfo/kml-devel/}{http://www.terborg.net/mailman/listinfo/kml-devel/},
including links to browse its archive, to subscribe and to unsubscribe. 

\section*{Feedback}

If you do have any questions, feedback, new algorithms, or success stories, 
please do not hesitate to contact us at kml-devel@terborg.net.
We endeavour to use any kind of feedback for improvement of the library, including the
on-line documentation.
