\section{Requirements}

Here the initial requirements for the kernel-machine library are formalised.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{It should be efficient.} Because kernel machines are all about
numerical computations, one of the most important topics will be to
achieve efficiency. Efficiency can be expressed in the big-O notation.
\item \textbf{It should have a clean API.}
Because it is a development library, one of the more difficult things
of the development of a software library compared with the development
of an end-user software tool is the quality of code: co-developers
have to be able to read the source code. Good documentation, good
use of comments, and sensible names of parameters can help. 
\item \textbf{It should be cross-platform.} With a dominance of more than
90\% of the desktop market, Microsoft Windows systems do contain many
potential users and should be well supported. It should be tested
on different operating systems. 
\item \textbf{It should be flexible.} It should be able to accommodate all
kinds of kernel machines, and therefore be able to process data set
formats used by other packages.
\item \textbf{It should be extensible.} In case an unforeseen situation
comes into play, it should be possible to adjust the library in line
with new ideas with minimal effort without altering the validity of
its contents.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
%
The exact design of software may depend on the capabilities of the language
it is written in. The C++ language is a \emph{multi-paradigm} language,
in other words, the language supports procedural, object-oriented,
and even functional program structures. Recently, one of C++'s features
achieved much attention: its template typing system is extremely powerful,
as it allows for Turing-complete programming during compile-time:
the time when the program is being compiled by a compiler. Run-time
is when the program is under execution, i.e., running. 

This has been an important issue in the design of the KML: selecting 
the actions to be taken in compile-time, and what actions will be executed in
run-time. The following may exemplify this distinction,

\highlightcpp{}
\begin{verbatim}
template<int N>
struct factorial{
  static const int value = N*factorial< N-1 >::value;
};

template< >
struct factorial< 0 >{
  static const int value = 1;
};
\end{verbatim}
and its run-time counterpart would look like as follows

\highlightcpp{}
\begin{verbatim}
int factorial_rt(int n){
  return ( n==0 ? 1 : n*factorial_rt(n-1) );
}
\end{verbatim}
%
Now, if a factorial needs to be computed from a known number N, this
can be done by the compiler at compile-time, reducing the number of
computations needed at run-time to zero. 
%
This idea may be taken much further, to arrive at the area of 
\emph{template meta-programming}.

A kernel machine is a term for a combination of several concepts:
a problem type, a kernel function and an algorithm. The problem type is the
type of problem to be solved, e.g. classification, regression, or
single class. Given a problem type, a kernel-machine states how the
problem is solved and by what mechanisms. For instance, for a regression
problem, an SVM has a mathematical optimisation problem different
from that for a classification problem. A kernel machine \emph{contains}
a kernel; it \emph{is} not a kernel. However, algorithms have been
devised that are specialised towards a kernel machine in combination
with a specific kernel. Therefore, a kernel can be responsible for
the selection of the algorithm used by the kernel machine.

Kernel machines sometimes solve identical problems in different ways:
here, trade-offs and guarantees of pre-learning and post-learning
come into play.
