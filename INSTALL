These are generic installation instructions.

Please be sure to have installed the following packages:

Scons  http://www.scons.org
Boost  http://www.boost.org
ATLAS  http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net

The Boost Numeric.Bindings are included in the Kernel-Machine library, but can also 
be downloaded seperately through Boost's sandbox CVS.

The KML contains a few optional bindings as well, these are included mostly for testing 
purposes. 

libfann - The fast Artificial Neural Network Library, which can do basic feed-forward neural
nets at decent speeds.


If all is installed, go to the top-level KML directory, and run scons

$ cd /foo/bar/kml
$ scons

to get the examples, test programs, some libraries, and under Windows, a CBLAS dll to be built.
