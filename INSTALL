/*! \page installation_page Installation

These are generic installation instructions.

Please be sure to have installed the following packages:

- Scons  http://www.scons.org
- Boost  http://www.boost.org
- ATLAS  http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net

The Boost Numeric.Bindings are included in the Kernel-Machine library, but can also 
be downloaded seperately through Boost's sandbox CVS.

The KML contains a few optional bindings as well, these are included mostly for testing 
purposes. 

libfann - The fast Artificial Neural Network Library, which can do basic feed-forward neural
nets at decent speeds.

\section building Building the Kernel-Machine library using Scons

To build KML out of the box on windows you will need to have ATLAS installed in /atlas, and
Boost in /boost.  You will also need either cygwin or mingw to build the CBLAS dll.  If they
installed in a location other than /mingw or /cygwin, you may need to modify lib/SConscript
for scons to execute correctly.  If you don't need to build the CBLAS dll, you can simply
remove the file lib/SConscript.

If all is installed, go to the top-level KML directory, and run scons

\verbatim
$ cd /foo/bar/kml
$ scons
\endverbatim

to get the examples, test programs, some libraries, and under Windows, a CBLAS dll to be built.
